# assembly-and-c

A collection of assembly implemented algorithms (64 bit addition, division, edit distance between 2 strings, knapsack, all possible combinations of a set, matrix multiplication) and c++ progams (floating point calculator, etc) that I wrote when taking ECS 50, my favorite course at Davis, also taught by my favorite professor, Matthew Butner.
