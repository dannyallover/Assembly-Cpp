Lets say we want to call the function foo(7, 10, 11)
but foo is actually a system call. Write assembly
code to call foo. Foo has a system call number 25
movl $25, %eax
movl $7, %ebx
movl $10, %ecx
movl $11, %edx
int $0x80
syscall bar(12, 18) syscall # 13
movl $13, %eax
movl $12, %ebx
movl $18, %ecx
int $0x80
# he went over how assembly works
# we then did some final review
