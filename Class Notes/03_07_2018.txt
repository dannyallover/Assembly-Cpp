When does the CPU respond to an interrupt?
the CPU checks the interrupt line at the end of every instruction
  Fetch
  Decode
  Execute
  Write
  Check for interrupt
What happens when an interrupt occurs during the handling of another
interrupt?
1. ignore interrupts inside the interrupt handler
  - handler disables interrupt
2. prioritize interrupts
  - interrupt the handler if the new interrupt is more
  important
Operating System (OS)
- we will assume a single CPU with a single core
# it can only run one program at once
- the OS is just a program
- the OS only has a special privileges because it is the "first"
program run
if your program is running is the OS running?
- No it can't
# we said it's a single core CPU
- control can switch between 2 programs if
1. voluntarily relinquishes control through a system call
# example: exit
2. Interrupt
What does the OS do?
- manage the resources of the computer and make sure they are
"fairly" distributed
# operating system is just a resource manager
1. Memory management
2. Process management
3. I/O management
4. File system management
If you want to run a program, say a.out, what do you do?
1. at the shell you type ./a.out
# the shell is not the operating system, it's some other program
2. shell calls execve(.\a.out)
3. locate a.out on the disk
4. read a.out's header
  - contains info about program
  - size
  - starting point aka _start
5. checks mem allocation table for a spot big enough
to put a.out and copies it there and then updates mem alloc table
6. save current state
-> set esp to a.outs stack
7. run a.out by jumping to a.out's _start
a.out is now running
OS boot up
Boot loader
- small simple program that loads the OS
- is stored on a ROM
- when an intel CPU turns on eip = 0xfffffff0
- it is located -> #there at 0xfffffff0
boot loader reads the first disk sector into
memory and then jumps to that location in mem
- OS will have placed a portion of itself at this
first disk sector when you installed it
- this portion of the OS reads the rest of the OS in
- the OS is now running
